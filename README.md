### FYI

As I don't have much infomation about "Top Runners", and after I checked the data, I found it's hard to get to know what top runners means. So I just pick up the top-Rating-users based on profile_id, and you can set variable "numOfTopRunner" to show up the number of runners in tableview. 

### How do I get set up? ###
